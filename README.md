# Magical Creatures API üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëªüßù

## Overview
This project is a **RESTful API** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose)**.  
It manages three magical data collections:

- **Beasts** ‚Äî magical animals (dragons, hippogriffs, etc.)  
- **Beings** ‚Äî intelligent races (goblins, centaurs, house-elves, etc.)  
- **Spirits** ‚Äî non-living entities (ghosts, dementors, boggarts, poltergeists)

The API demonstrates full CRUD operations, schema validation, indexing considerations, and is seeded with sample data.

Reflection (Optional)
1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I could have mapped out the collections and their relationships earlier, which would have made setting up models and routes smoother.

2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

Adding validation rules and indexes was the most challenging part. More practice with Mongoose schema options would make this easier next time.

3. What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?

With more time, I would add authentication so users could securely create and manage data.

4. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:

For future projects, I will start with a clear data model diagram, test routes often, and commit changes frequently to avoid big errors later.
